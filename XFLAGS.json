In the Middle Ages the Åland archipelago was a province of Sweden. Ecclesiastically the islands belonged to the diocese of Abo (Turku) in Finland, and so the province was lost to Russia in 1809. The issue was finally settled by the League of Nations in 1921. The islands were to be a part of Finland, but they were to enjoy autonomy.\\n\\nHowever, a flag was not granted until 1954. Unofficially a blue-yellow-blue triband had been in use from 1922. Several versions existed, the dominating one had equal horizontal bands. Another version had a narrower band of yellow - as when the vertical yellow stripe in the cross on the Swedish flag is taken away.\\n\\nBlue and yellow were naturally the favourite colours, being both the colours of Sweden and the colours of the provincial coat of arms (a golden deer on blue), Therefore, when preparing a design for adoption in the early 1950s, the favoured design was a Scandinavian cross design of a blue field and a yellow and blue cross - that is, the flag of Sweden with an extra blue cross in the middle. This proposal was rejected by the president of Finland as too similar to the Swedish flag. Alternative designs were the old blue-yellow-blue triband, the flag of Finland with an extra yellow cross in the middle, and a design where a red cross was added to the Swedish pattern.\\n\\nThe outcome of the process was the adoption of the blue-yellow- red Scandinavian cross design. This flag was first hoisted on the town hall in the provincial capital Mariehamn 3 April 1954. The red colour was controversial at first, because people felt it lacked a local tradition. However, the colours can be said to come from the provincial coat of arms (blue and yellow - also Sweden's colours) and the colours of the coat of arms of Finland (red and yellow). Also, experts in heraldry have found out that at one point a Swedish king hoisted a flag of exactly the same design."},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_12","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_0","pctRED_88","pctYEL_0","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_0","pctGRA_0\r\n"],"Code":"[ALB]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/640px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","year":"1443, 1912, 1992, 2002","Items":["myrRED","NoBand","NoStar","Animal","Center","2Color","area_28748","capi_Tirana","pm_Edi Rama","md_deno_n","balkan","rg3_romanempire","noeuni","rg2_EU_South"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_BLA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","Items2":["balkan","rg3_romanempire","noeuni","rg2_EU_South"],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"Albania","subtype":null,"describe":"The red stands for bravery, strength, valour and bloodshed, while the Eagle, traditionally the symbol of Albanians, represents the sovereign state of Albania. "},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_0","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_46","pctRED_7","pctYEL_0","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_47","pctGRA_0\r\n"],"Code":"[ALG]","Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/k6GbsFg/Algeria-Flag.png","year":"1962","Items":["HasSta","myrEQ","2Bands","001GRE","003WHI","staRED","1Stars","Vertic","IsMoon","Center","3Color","calendar","area_2381741","capi_Algiers","pm_Sifi Ghrieb","top30_camel","top30_oil","geo_CapiBeach","md_deno_n","calendar","arabic","rg2_AF_North"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Algeria","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_GRE","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Algeria.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Algeria.svg.png","Items2":["calendar","arabic","rg2_AF_North"],"region":"rgn_Africa","couname":"Algeria","subtype":null,"describe":"The flag aims to highlight Algeria's cultural heritage, but there are different interpretations of its elements.

The design of the Ghanaian flag influenced the designs of the flags of Guinea-Bissau (1973) and São Tomé and Príncipe (1975)."},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_2","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_0","pctRED_40","pctYEL_4","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_53","pctGRA_0"],"Code":"[GIB]","Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/G0GmXzF/Gibraltar-Flag.png","year":"1982","Items":["myrWHI","2Bands","001WHI","003RED","NoStar","Horizo","Center","Builds","4Color","area_6.8","capi_Gibraltar","pm_Fabian Picardo","geo_CapiBeach","md_deno_n","ntWHYE","noeuni","terr_brit","terr_all","monarchy","englis","rg2_EU_South"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Gibraltar","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_WHI","cl_YEL","cl_BLA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flag_of_Gibraltar.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Gibraltar.svg.png","Items2":["noeuni","terr_brit","terr_all","monarchy","englis","rg2_EU_South"],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"Gibraltar","subtype":null,"describe":"The white color symbolizes peace and honesty.

However, it has been suggested that the red and white symbolism can trace its origin to the older common Austronesian mythology of the duality of Mother Earth (red) and Father Sky (white). This is why these colours appear in so many flags throughout Austronesia, from Tahiti to Madagascar. The earliest records of the red and white panji or pataka (a long flag on a curved bamboo pole) can be found in the Pararaton chronicle; according to this source, the Jayakatwang troops from Gelang-Gelang hoisted the red and white banner during their invasion of Singhasari in the early 12th century. This suggests that even before the Majapahit era, the red and white colours were already revered and used as the kingdom's banner in the Kediri era (1042 – c.1222).\\n\\nRed and white textile colouring was available in ancient Indonesia. White is the natural colour of woven cotton fabrics, while red is one of the earliest natural dyes, acquired either from teak leaves, the flowers of Averrhoa bilimbi, or the skin of mangosteen fruits.\\n\\nIt was not only the Javanese kingdoms that used red and white. The battle flag of King Si Singamangaraja IX of Batak lands bore an image of white twin swords called piso gaja dompak against a red background. During the Aceh War of 1873–1904, Aceh warriors used a battle flag with the image of a sword, star and crescent, sun, and some Quranic script in white on a red background. The red and white flag of the Buginese Bone kingdom in South Sulawesi is called Woromporang. The Balinese Badung (Puri Pamecutan) royal banner is red, white, and black. Prince Diponegoro also used a red and white banner during the Java War (1825–1830).\\n\\nIn the early 20th century, these colours were revived by students and then nationalists as an expression of nationalism against the Dutch. A precursor design was first seen on the cover of a Dutch magazine titled Gedenkboek 1908-1923 run by the Perhimpoenan Indonesia ('Indonesian Association'). Compiling 13 letters written by its anonymous members, it had a sinister hoisted flag of a red and white stripe superimposed with the head of a banteng facing away from the hoist. The modern red and white flag sans banteng head was first flown in Java in 1928, it was quickly prohibited under Dutch rule.

This influence was clear when Senegal linked with the Sudanese Republic (now Mali) in the Mali Federation on April 4, 1959, and adopted a vertical tricolour of green-yellow-red with a central representation in black of a human figure known as the kanaga. Independence followed on August 20, 1960, but the federation ended and Senegal became a separate country with its own flag in September. \\n\\nSenegal retained the green-yellow-red flag but substituted a green star for the kanaga. Green is seen as a symbol of hope and of the country’s major religions, while yellow is for natural riches and the wealth derived from labour. Red recalls the independence struggle, life, and socialism.

It is worn as a pendant on the islands—along with two leaves of the local namele tree. These leaves are supposed to be a token of peace, and their 39 leaflets represent the original 39 members of the Parliament of Vanuatu."},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_1","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_0","pctRED_2","pctYEL_56","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_40","pctGRA_1"],"Code":"[VAT]","Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/jDQ6ycM/Vatican-Flag.png","year":"1929, 2000, 2023","Items":["myrYEL","2Bands","001YEL","003WHI","NoStar","Crosse","Vertic","Circle","Crowns","5+Color","area_0.49","capi_Vatican City","pm_Pope Leo XIV","landlo","locate_MI","md_acreed123","md_deno_n","rg3_romanempire","noeuni","monarchy","cur_EUR","italia","rg2_EU_South"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Vatican_City","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_YEL","cl_WHI","cl_RED","cl_BLA","cl_GRA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Flag_of_Vatican_City_%282023%E2%80%93present%29.svg/2048px-Flag_of_Vatican_City_%282023%E2%80%93present%29.svg.png","Items2":["rg3_romanempire","noeuni","monarchy","cur_EUR","italia","rg2_EU_South"],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"Vatican City","subtype":null,"describe":"The papal coat of arms and banner were red with two crossed gold keys, referring to the keys mentioned in the New Testament and symbolizing either the access that St. Peter was given to the kingdom of heaven or papal claims to dominion over both spiritual and temporal matters.

Mettig believed that, in case of Ventspils, the use of a hunting horn could be associated with a mere practical thing – hunting, given that one of the closest assistants of the Komtur was a special falconer who caught, tamed, and trained falcons for hunting."},{"New":".","Code":"[MAL]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Flag_of_Johor.svg/640px-Flag_of_Johor.svg.png","type":"State","year":"1871","Items":["HasSta","myrBLU","NoBand","staWHI","1Stars","IsMoon","Canton","3Color"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Johor","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_RED","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Flag_of_Johor.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Johor.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Asia","couname":"[MAL] Johor","subtype":null,"describe":"The flag in general attempts to symbolise Johor as a whole.

The origin of the saltire is disputed. Its association with Saint Patrick dates from the 1780s, when the Anglo-Irish Order of Saint Patrick adopted it as an emblem. This was a British chivalric order established in 1783 by George III. It has been suggested that it derives from the arms of the powerful Geraldine or FitzGerald dynasty. Some Irish nationalists and others reject its use to represent Ireland as a 'British invention 'for a people who had never used it'.\\nAfter its adoption by the Order of Saint Patrick, it began to be used by other institutions. When the Acts of Union 1800 joined the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain, the saltire was added to the British flag to form the Union Flag still used by the United Kingdom. The saltire has occasionally served unofficially to represent Northern Ireland and also appears in some royal events.[5]"},{"New":".","Code":"[NIU]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg/640px-Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg.png","type":"Village","year":"???","Items":["HasSta","myrWHI","3Bands","001WHI","002BLA","003WHI","staBLA","3+Star","Horizo","Circle","Center","2Color"],"links":"https://www.fotw.info/flags/nu-hak.html","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_WHI","cl_BLA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Oceania","couname":"[NIU] Hakupu","subtype":null,"describe":"The flag design consist of a black stripe running through a circle with 3 black stars inside of it.

It is based on the chromatic composition created in 1801 by Francisco Miranda, precursor of Latin American independence, who flew the pavilion in Jacmel, Haiti for the first time. As to the meaning of the colors, the most accepted hypothesis states that it is based on the primary colors as perceived by the iris. A second theory states that it is based on the colors of the primitive coat of arms of Christopher Columbus, and lastly, a third theory says that it is based on the colors of the uniforms of the Burgerwache in Hamburg. The first theory is based in a letter, where Miranda describes a conversation with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about its Theory of colours at a party hosted in the city of Weimar in 1785. The santeños Patriots took this model to represent Los Santos in 1821 in the battle to gain independence from Spain. With the creation of the province of Azuero on April 4, 1850 this flag became the official flag of the province and subsequently, became the official flag of Los Santos province, heir of the former Azuero province."},{"New":".","Code":"[PAU]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg/1024px-Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg.png","type":"State","year":"???","Items":["HasSta","myrEQ","3Bands","001GRE","002BLA","003BLU","staWHI","3+Star","Horizo","Center","4Color"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_states_of_Palau#","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_BLA","cl_BLU","cl_GRE","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Oceania","couname":"[PAU] Aimelik","subtype":null,"describe":"The five stars represent the five hamlets of Aimeliik.
