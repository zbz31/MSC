In the Middle Ages the Åland archipelago was a province of Sweden. Ecclesiastically the islands belonged to the diocese of Abo (Turku) in Finland, and so the province was lost to Russia in 1809. The issue was finally settled by the League of Nations in 1921. The islands were to be a part of Finland, but they were to enjoy autonomy.\\n\\nHowever, a flag was not granted until 1954. Unofficially a blue-yellow-blue triband had been in use from 1922. Several versions existed, the dominating one had equal horizontal bands. Another version had a narrower band of yellow - as when the vertical yellow stripe in the cross on the Swedish flag is taken away.\\n\\nBlue and yellow were naturally the favourite colours, being both the colours of Sweden and the colours of the provincial coat of arms (a golden deer on blue), Therefore, when preparing a design for adoption in the early 1950s, the favoured design was a Scandinavian cross design of a blue field and a yellow and blue cross - that is, the flag of Sweden with an extra blue cross in the middle. This proposal was rejected by the president of Finland as too similar to the Swedish flag. Alternative designs were the old blue-yellow-blue triband, the flag of Finland with an extra yellow cross in the middle, and a design where a red cross was added to the Swedish pattern.\\n\\nThe outcome of the process was the adoption of the blue-yellow- red Scandinavian cross design. This flag was first hoisted on the town hall in the provincial capital Mariehamn 3 April 1954. The red colour was controversial at first, because people felt it lacked a local tradition. However, the colours can be said to come from the provincial coat of arms (blue and yellow - also Sweden's colours) and the colours of the coat of arms of Finland (red and yellow). Also, experts in heraldry have found out that at one point a Swedish king hoisted a flag of exactly the same design."},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_12","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_0","pctRED_88","pctYEL_0","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_0","pctGRA_0\r\n"],"Code":"[ALB]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/640px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","year":"1443, 1912, 1992, 2002","Items":["myrRED","NoBand","NoStar","Animal","Center","2Color","area_28748","capi_Tirana","pm_Edi Rama","md_deno_n","balkan","rg3_romanempire","noeuni","rg2_EU_South"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_BLA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png","Items2":["balkan","rg3_romanempire","noeuni","rg2_EU_South"],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"Albania","subtype":null,"describe":"The red stands for bravery, strength, valour and bloodshed, while the Eagle, traditionally the symbol of Albanians, represents the sovereign state of Albania. "},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_0","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_46","pctRED_7","pctYEL_0","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_47","pctGRA_0\r\n"],"Code":"[ALG]","Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/k6GbsFg/Algeria-Flag.png","year":"1962","Items":["HasSta","myrEQ","2Bands","001GRE","003WHI","staRED","1Stars","Vertic","IsMoon","Center","3Color","calendar","area_2381741","capi_Algiers","pm_Sifi Ghrieb","top30_camel","top30_oil","geo_CapiBeach","md_deno_n","calendar","arabic","rg2_AF_North"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Algeria","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_GRE","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Algeria.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Algeria.svg.png","Items2":["calendar","arabic","rg2_AF_North"],"region":"rgn_Africa","couname":"Algeria","subtype":null,"describe":"The flag aims to highlight Algeria's cultural heritage, but there are different interpretations of its elements.

The design of the Ghanaian flag influenced the designs of the flags of Guinea-Bissau (1973) and São Tomé and Príncipe (1975)."},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_2","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_0","pctRED_40","pctYEL_4","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_53","pctGRA_0"],"Code":"[GIB]","Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/G0GmXzF/Gibraltar-Flag.png","year":"1982","Items":["myrWHI","2Bands","001WHI","003RED","NoStar","Horizo","Center","Builds","4Color","area_6.8","capi_Gibraltar","pm_Fabian Picardo","geo_CapiBeach","md_deno_n","ntWHYE","noeuni","terr_brit","terr_all","monarchy","englis","rg2_EU_South"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Gibraltar","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_WHI","cl_YEL","cl_BLA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flag_of_Gibraltar.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Gibraltar.svg.png","Items2":["noeuni","terr_brit","terr_all","monarchy","englis","rg2_EU_South"],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"Gibraltar","subtype":null,"describe":"The white color symbolizes peace and honesty.

However, it has been suggested that the red and white symbolism can trace its origin to the older common Austronesian mythology of the duality of Mother Earth (red) and Father Sky (white). This is why these colours appear in so many flags throughout Austronesia, from Tahiti to Madagascar. The earliest records of the red and white panji or pataka (a long flag on a curved bamboo pole) can be found in the Pararaton chronicle; according to this source, the Jayakatwang troops from Gelang-Gelang hoisted the red and white banner during their invasion of Singhasari in the early 12th century. This suggests that even before the Majapahit era, the red and white colours were already revered and used as the kingdom's banner in the Kediri era (1042 – c.1222).\\n\\nRed and white textile colouring was available in ancient Indonesia. White is the natural colour of woven cotton fabrics, while red is one of the earliest natural dyes, acquired either from teak leaves, the flowers of Averrhoa bilimbi, or the skin of mangosteen fruits.\\n\\nIt was not only the Javanese kingdoms that used red and white. The battle flag of King Si Singamangaraja IX of Batak lands bore an image of white twin swords called piso gaja dompak against a red background. During the Aceh War of 1873–1904, Aceh warriors used a battle flag with the image of a sword, star and crescent, sun, and some Quranic script in white on a red background. The red and white flag of the Buginese Bone kingdom in South Sulawesi is called Woromporang. The Balinese Badung (Puri Pamecutan) royal banner is red, white, and black. Prince Diponegoro also used a red and white banner during the Java War (1825–1830).\\n\\nIn the early 20th century, these colours were revived by students and then nationalists as an expression of nationalism against the Dutch. A precursor design was first seen on the cover of a Dutch magazine titled Gedenkboek 1908-1923 run by the Perhimpoenan Indonesia ('Indonesian Association'). Compiling 13 letters written by its anonymous members, it had a sinister hoisted flag of a red and white stripe superimposed with the head of a banteng facing away from the hoist. The modern red and white flag sans banteng head was first flown in Java in 1928, it was quickly prohibited under Dutch rule.

This influence was clear when Senegal linked with the Sudanese Republic (now Mali) in the Mali Federation on April 4, 1959, and adopted a vertical tricolour of green-yellow-red with a central representation in black of a human figure known as the kanaga. Independence followed on August 20, 1960, but the federation ended and Senegal became a separate country with its own flag in September. \\n\\nSenegal retained the green-yellow-red flag but substituted a green star for the kanaga. Green is seen as a symbol of hope and of the country’s major religions, while yellow is for natural riches and the wealth derived from labour. Red recalls the independence struggle, life, and socialism.

It is worn as a pendant on the islands—along with two leaves of the local namele tree. These leaves are supposed to be a token of peace, and their 39 leaflets represent the original 39 members of the Parliament of Vanuatu."},{"New":".","ptg":["pctBLA_1","pctBLU_0","pctGRE_0","pctRED_2","pctYEL_56","pctORA_0","pctBRO_0","pctPUR_0","pctWHI_40","pctGRA_1"],"Code":"[VAT]","Flag":"https://i.ibb.co/jDQ6ycM/Vatican-Flag.png","year":"1929, 2000, 2023","Items":["myrYEL","2Bands","001YEL","003WHI","NoStar","Crosse","Vertic","Circle","Crowns","5+Color","area_0.49","capi_Vatican City","pm_Pope Leo XIV","landlo","locate_MI","md_acreed123","md_deno_n","rg3_romanempire","noeuni","monarchy","cur_EUR","italia","rg2_EU_South"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Vatican_City","lvlup":"1","Colors":["cl_YEL","cl_WHI","cl_RED","cl_BLA","cl_GRA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Flag_of_Vatican_City_%282023%E2%80%93present%29.svg/2048px-Flag_of_Vatican_City_%282023%E2%80%93present%29.svg.png","Items2":["rg3_romanempire","noeuni","monarchy","cur_EUR","italia","rg2_EU_South"],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"Vatican City","subtype":null,"describe":"The papal coat of arms and banner were red with two crossed gold keys, referring to the keys mentioned in the New Testament and symbolizing either the access that St. Peter was given to the kingdom of heaven or papal claims to dominion over both spiritual and temporal matters.

Mettig believed that, in case of Ventspils, the use of a hunting horn could be associated with a mere practical thing – hunting, given that one of the closest assistants of the Komtur was a special falconer who caught, tamed, and trained falcons for hunting."},{"New":".","Code":"[MAL]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Flag_of_Johor.svg/640px-Flag_of_Johor.svg.png","type":"State","year":"1871","Items":["HasSta","myrBLU","NoBand","staWHI","1Stars","IsMoon","Canton","3Color"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Johor","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_RED","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Flag_of_Johor.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Johor.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Asia","couname":"[MAL] Johor","subtype":null,"describe":"The flag in general attempts to symbolise Johor as a whole.

The origin of the saltire is disputed. Its association with Saint Patrick dates from the 1780s, when the Anglo-Irish Order of Saint Patrick adopted it as an emblem. This was a British chivalric order established in 1783 by George III. It has been suggested that it derives from the arms of the powerful Geraldine or FitzGerald dynasty. Some Irish nationalists and others reject its use to represent Ireland as a 'British invention 'for a people who had never used it'.\\nAfter its adoption by the Order of Saint Patrick, it began to be used by other institutions. When the Acts of Union 1800 joined the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain, the saltire was added to the British flag to form the Union Flag still used by the United Kingdom. The saltire has occasionally served unofficially to represent Northern Ireland and also appears in some royal events.[5]"},{"New":".","Code":"[NIU]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg/640px-Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg.png","type":"Village","year":"???","Items":["HasSta","myrWHI","3Bands","001WHI","002BLA","003WHI","staBLA","3+Star","Horizo","Circle","Center","2Color"],"links":"https://www.fotw.info/flags/nu-hak.html","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_WHI","cl_BLA"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Hakupu%2C_Niue.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Oceania","couname":"[NIU] Hakupu","subtype":null,"describe":"The flag design consist of a black stripe running through a circle with 3 black stars inside of it.

It is based on the chromatic composition created in 1801 by Francisco Miranda, precursor of Latin American independence, who flew the pavilion in Jacmel, Haiti for the first time. As to the meaning of the colors, the most accepted hypothesis states that it is based on the primary colors as perceived by the iris. A second theory states that it is based on the colors of the primitive coat of arms of Christopher Columbus, and lastly, a third theory says that it is based on the colors of the uniforms of the Burgerwache in Hamburg. The first theory is based in a letter, where Miranda describes a conversation with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about its Theory of colours at a party hosted in the city of Weimar in 1785. The santeños Patriots took this model to represent Los Santos in 1821 in the battle to gain independence from Spain. With the creation of the province of Azuero on April 4, 1850 this flag became the official flag of the province and subsequently, became the official flag of Los Santos province, heir of the former Azuero province."},{"New":".","Code":"[PAU]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg/1024px-Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg.png","type":"State","year":"???","Items":["HasSta","myrEQ","3Bands","001GRE","002BLA","003BLU","staWHI","3+Star","Horizo","Center","4Color"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_states_of_Palau#","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_BLA","cl_BLU","cl_GRE","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Aimeliik.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Oceania","couname":"[PAU] Aimelik","subtype":null,"describe":"The five stars represent the five hamlets of Aimeliik.

It has considerable mineral resources, but a disastrous leak of mine tailings in 1996 forced the closure of the copper mines. Its chief products are coconuts, rice, maize, fruits, vegetables, livestock, fish, wood, and the products of a number of small-scale industries. Off the coast are three small islands called the Three Kings, individually Gaspar, Melchor, and Baltazar, a favoured spot for day-trips and diving; a Spanish galleon was found off Gaspar in forty meters of water in 1981.

Since the creation of the flag in 1961, the charges on the arms have experienced some changes in the way they are represented. The changes have been just details, but the same elements are always represented. These cosmetic changes were made in 1965, 1992, and 2001.\\n\\nThe coat of arms of the city is quartered with the following elements:\\n\\n-In the first quarter an image of the Virgin Nuestra Señora de la Asunción over a cloud ascending to the sky. That is the Virgin that gives its name to the city of Asunción.\\n\\n-In the second quarter, an image of San Blas blessing with his right hand and holding his crosier with his left hand. San Blas was a priest and lawyer originally from Paraguay.\\n\\n-In the third quarter a castle representing the fortification that gave origin to the city and from where several expeditions, that founded other cities, started. The open door and window of the castle stand for the hospitality of the city.\\n\\n-In the fourth quarter a lion, a leafy tree, and a palm tree. The leafy tree represents the tree of Viscaya, the place where the founder of Asunción Domingo Martínez de Irala was born. The lion stands for the Spaniards' conquistadores who were mainly from the kingdoms of Castile and León. It also stands for the courage of the people of Asunción. Finally, the palm tree represents the native element. The tail of the lion around the palm tree represents the union between the Spanish and the Guarani people."},{"New":".","Code":"[PRY]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Flag_of_Paraguay_%28reverse%29.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Paraguay_%28reverse%29.svg.png","type":"National","year":"1842, 2013","Items":["myrEQ","3Bands","001RED","002WHI","003BLU","NoStar","Horizo","Circle","Animal","Texted","Center","5+Color"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Paraguay","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_RED","cl_WHI","cl_BLU","cl_BLA","cl_YEL","cl_BRO"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Flag_of_Paraguay_%28reverse%29.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Paraguay_%28reverse%29.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_South America","couname":"[PRY] Paraguay (Reverse)","subtype":null,"describe":"The emblem on the reverse side is the seal of the treasury: a yellow lion below a red Phrygian cap on the top of a pole (symbolising courage) and the words Paz y Justicia ('Peace and Justice')."},{"New":".","Code":"[PSE]","Flag":"https://www.fotw.info/images/p/ps-gaza.gif","type":"Municipality","year":"???","Items":["myrWHI","NoBand","NoStar","Animal","Texted","Center","5+Color"],"links":"https://www.fotw.info/flags/ps-gaza.html","lvlup":"2","Colors":["cl_WHI","cl_BLA","cl_RED","cl_GRE","cl_GRA"],"HDFlag":"https://www.fotw.info/images/p/ps-gaza.gif","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Asia","couname":"[PSE] Gaza","subtype":null,"describe":"The Municipality of Gaza is in the Gaza Strip.

On the central tower, an angel in black, haloed and holding a stick topped by a cross.\\nThe castle represents the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, the official residence of the Kings of Majorca, located in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Balearic Islands.\\n\\n\\nThe Palace of La Almudaina, which formed the earliest nucleus of the town of Palma, has been the main residence of the successive rulers of Majorca. Shaped like an irregular rectangle, the palace overlooks the lower town and the bay, constituting a convenient watch post. The palace is surrounded by a thick wall including 14 square towers of the same height but one; the higher tower has been known since the 14th century as the Angel's Tower, for the statue that surmounts it. Designed by the Catalan sculptor Arnau de Camprodón upon request of King James II (1276-1311), the statue represents the Guardian Angel who protected the town and the Kingdom of Majorca. Within the walls are located the Royal premises: the main hall, the king's chapel, dedicated to St. Ann, the queen's apartments, remains of the queen's chapel dedicated to St. John, cellars, and the king and queen's gardens.\\nA fortification already existed in the Roman period, but probably of much lesser extent, since the town of Palma had no special significance at the time. Accordingly, no detail on its architecture has been recorded. The historian Guillem Rossell&ocaute; Bordoy (b. 1932) provided evidence that the fortified wall was erected during the Muslim period, at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries. At the time, the main fortress, of square shape and protected by thick towers, was located in the south-western corner of the area enclosed by the wall, that is, in the present-day's location of the Angel's Tower.\\nOn 2 February 1115, Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer III (1086-1131) assaulted Medina Mayurca, partially destroyed the wall and entered the city. Severely damaged, the palace was rebuilt after the Christians' withdrawal. In the aftermath of the definitive conquest of the island, achieved in 1231, James II ordered in the beginning of the 14th century the revamping and increase of the palace, whose external aspect has been hardly modified since then.\\nIn 1960-1970, José F. Conrado led a complete restoration of the palace, re-establishing its medieval aspect by removing accessory buildings erected in subsequent periods.\\n[Bartomeu Bestard (official town chronicler). El palacio de la Almudaina. Diario de Palma, 15 June 2008]\\n\\nIn 1309, King James II commissioned the sculptor Arnau de Camprodón to produce a statue of the Guardian Angel (Gabriel). The statue was to be placed atop a tower of the palace that was being rebuilt on the ruins of the Muslim fortress as the future official residence of the new rulers.\\nIn January 2010, the sculptor when to Sineu, a town located in the center of the island, where the king had his palace - subsequently kept as his secondary residence. Documents provide evidence of detailed discussions between the artist and his patron about the design of the angelot. Back to Palma, the sculptor designed the frame of the statue in poplar wood, which he subsequently covered with brass sheets. According to José María Quadrado (1819-1896), the angel bears on the chest a plaque inscribed 'Et verbum caro factum est' (John 1.14,The Word became flesh).\\nOnce the sculptor completed the statue, 50 days later than promised, he transported it on a donkey to Sineu. Satisfied, the king ordered it would be placed on the highest tower of the restored palace, soon known as the Angel's Tower. The angel became the symbol of the kings of Majorca. The chapel of the royal palace of Perpignan is also surmounted with an angel. King James III placed an angel as the crest on his knight's helmet, as shown in the first miniature decorating the Palatine Law, a codex issued in 1337.\\nThe island's people and institutions maintained the devotion to the Guardian Angel long after the suppression of the kingdom of Majorca. Among the four solemn festivals celebrated in Palma, the festival of the Guardian Angel was the most prized and attended.

The Catalan-Aragonese bars\\nNo evidence of any flag proper to Minorca was found; there is, however, significant evidence of the use of the Catalan-Aragonese emblems all along the Christian history of the island.\\nThe four-striped flag was present in 1232, when the Moorish rulers of the island plead allegiance to five Catalan knights. The royal emblems were formally imported to the island by Count of Barcelona Alfonso II the Liberal (1285-1291), who conquered the island from the Muslims in 1287. The four-pallet shield was sculpted on several buildings dated from the 14th to the 18th century: the vault of the Moon's Gate in the cathedral, keystones in the old St. Clare convent, the St. Roch Gate in Maó-Mahón, the gate of the St. Francis church in Ciutadella, the coat of arms of the old Universitat General (see 2., below), the entrance of the Town Hall of Alaior, and a keystone in the Town Hall of Ciutadella. Moreover, the governors of Minorca consistently used a four-pallet seal in the 16th and 17th centuries, and probably before; older seals were lost during the Ottoman raids on Maó-Mahón (1536) and Ciutadella (1558).\\n\\n2. The coat of arms of the Universitat General\\nThe Universitat General, located in Ciutadella, was the municipal administration of the island; in the 15th century, it was structured into four secondary universitats, located in Ciutadella, Maó-Mahón, Alaior, and Es Mercadal and Castell de Santa Agueda, which remained subordinated to the Universitat General. This municipal system was maintained until the beginning of the 19th century.\\nThe arms of the Universitat General featured a fortified town, represented in three main variants:\\n- Seals appended to documents dated 1465 and 1556 feature the first version of the arms, matching the design sculpted in the main staircase of the Town Hall of Ciutadella and in the vault of the Moon's Gate of the cathedral. Confirmed in 1300 by James II, this seal was used until 1558, and subsequently used by Ciutadella as its municipal seal until the late 19th century.\\n- The Universitat General and the Ciutadella Universitat Particular used from the 16th to the 18th century the second variant of the arms. Orled by the inscription 'LA UNIVERSITAT DE LA ILLA DE MENORCA', the seal features a tower topped by a staff surmounted by a cross potent and a vane pointing to the right. The tower surmounts a building and is surrounded by a pentagonal wall with a gate in the front and four angle towers leaning towards the central tower. On the left and right are placed to crowned shields of Catalonia-Aragón; the whole design is inscribed in an octagon with curvilinear sides.\\n- The seal used in the 19th century transports the perspective horizon of the former version; it was also used by the Ciutadella Health Service.\\n\\nThe commission concluded that the emblem used during the resettlement of Minorca in 1287 and since the infeudation of the island (1232) was made of four red stripes on a red field. To highlight the island's idiosyncrasy, the commission recommended to add the emblem of the old Universitat General to the four-striped flag to compose the flag of Minorca. The first version of the arms of the Universitat General should be preferred for the sake of seniority; it is, however, already used by the town of Ciutadella, and should be preferred the second variant, which would be specific to the island.\\n[La Bandera de l'Illa de Menorca, Minorca Island's Council]\\n\\nIvan Sache, 25 February 2018\\n\\nErroneous representations of the flag\\nFlag"},{"New":"w3","Code":"[ESP]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Flag_of_Lanzarote.svg/640px-Flag_of_Lanzarote.svg.png","type":"Province","year":"???","Items":["myrRED","2Bands","001RED","003BLU","NoStar","dgband","Circle","Plants","Center","Crowns","5+Color"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzarote","lvlup":"3","Colors":["cl_BLA","cl_BLU","cl_GRE","cl_RED","cl_YEL","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Flag_of_Lanzarote.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Lanzarote.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"[ESP] Lanzarote","subtype":"[ESP] Canary Islands","describe":"The flag of Lanzarote is in proportions 2:3, divided red-blue per bend sinister.

The canton has since been enlarged to cover a quarter of the flag, thus displacing the harp towards the fly.\\nVincent Morley, 26 October 1996\\n\\nThe official flag used by the city council places three burning castles in the the canton of a green flag which has a large gold harp in the fly. This is the only flag flown by the city authorities - it can always be seen flying at both the mansion house (the residence of the mayor) and the city hall, where the city council meets, and often at other buildings owned by the city council. The flag used by the public, in both the city and Dublin county as a whole (the county covers a larger area than the city) is a dark blue/light blue bicolour - most commonly arranged vertically with the dark blue in the hoist. This flag is commonly seen but has no official status.\\nVincent Morley, 13 September 2003\\n\\nThe castle of Dublin first appears in the 13th century seal of the city. On the seal Dublin is clearly under siege, from the central tower two sentries sound the alarm, while on each flanking tower stands an archer with a cross-bow. It probably depicts the readiness of the citizens, not an actual siege. Later, the single tower was replaced by three different castles, the small figures were replaced by flames from the towers. The fire indicates the zeal of the citizens in defence of the city.\\nSource: International Civic Heraldry site, 27 March 2004"},{"New":"45935","Code":"[IRE]","Flag":"https://www.fotw.info/images/i/ie-dub!1.gif","type":"Proposal","year":"0","Items":["myrBLU","4+Band","NoStar","Crosse","Horizo","Vertic","Nordic","OnlyBa","2Color"],"links":"https://www.fotw.info/flags/ie-dub.html#prop","lvlup":"3","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://www.fotw.info/images/i/ie-dub!1.gif","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"[IRE] Dublin County (Vexillology Ireland / Brateolaíocht Éireann Proposal)","subtype":"[IRE] Leinster","describe":"A proposal for the flag of historic Dublin County by Vexillology Ireland, branch of the Genealogical Society of Ireland, was published in August 2015 in the book Flagging Ireland [1, 2].

The coat of arms itself is complex - it showcases a white city wall with three towers and an open gate. On the outer towers we can see figures of two saints, St. Peter with a papal key, and St. Paul with a sword. Next to each saint we can see a six-pointed star with a half moon below it. Above the central tower there's another coat of arms embedded, a white eagle with a golden crown on a red shield. In the open gate there are two keys crossed in x-shape, with a small cross above them. The entire thing is located within a light blue escutcheon.

There is a number of possible explanations of the meaning of this coat of arms.\\nOne states that five-petaled rose means five wounds of Jesus Christ, and thus the symbol represents the passion of Christ, with green representing the hope for God's forgiveness. \\nOther interpretation states that red roses could forebode prosperity and good luck for the citizens of Biała in making their town prosperous.\\nThere's also an explanation which states that the roses were simply borrowed from some noble family, like the house of Wettin"},{"New":".","Code":"[POL]","Flag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/POL_Cz%C4%99stochowa_flag.svg/640px-POL_Cz%C4%99stochowa_flag.svg.png","type":"City","year":"1992","Items":["myrEQ","3Bands","001WHI","002YEL","003BLU","NoStar","Horizo","OnlyBa","3Color"],"links":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cz%C4%99stochowa","lvlup":"3","Colors":["cl_BLU","cl_YEL","cl_WHI"],"HDFlag":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/POL_Cz%C4%99stochowa_flag.svg/1024px-POL_Cz%C4%99stochowa_flag.svg.png","Items2":[],"region":"rgn_Europe","couname":"[POL] Częstochowa","subtype":"[POL] Silesian Voivodeship","describe":"The flag is composed of three horizontal bands in proportions 4:1:4, the colours being respectively white, yellow, and blue.

The shield of the seal was originally designed for the Republic of Hawaii in 1895. The red, white, and blue stripes of the first and fourth quarters come from the Hawaiian national flag (now the state flag). The eight stripes in each quarter represent the eight inhabited islands under one rule. The pulo'ulo'u are markers used in ancient times and during the monarchy, composed of a ball-like object, often cloth-covered, that was pierced by a stick and stuck in the ground to mark off areas reserved for nobility and royalty and beyond which commoners were forbidden to pass. The early balls were white, and later they were sometimes gold. These kapu markers symbolize authority and protection. The star in the center is the Star of Hawaii, and the rising sun symbolizes a new era dawning on
